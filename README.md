👋🏼 Hello! مرحبا

🔨 I'm currently working on some personal projects while publishing some bits and bobs that seem like they might be useful to the open source community.

✨ I'm interested in learning new languages and technologies, networking and collaboration, and building new and useful things.

😻 My cat Fuji is a frequent collaborator.

👨🏻‍💻 Spaces. Two. 120.

🚀 Your sponsorship will enable me to spend more time contributing to open source projects. Thanks for your support!

🏳️‍🌈🇵🇸✊🏿⛺️🎶 You are not alone.
